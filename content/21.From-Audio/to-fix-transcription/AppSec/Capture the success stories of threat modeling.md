**Capture the success stories of your threat models **

The key element of doing threat modeling is that it can highlight all sorts of interesting issues and blind spots in particular architecture. One of my favorite comment is "when the people get involved, the developers and the architects do a threat model and they realize something that they hadn't noticed before".

Sometimes the developer who says, "oh, I never realized how it worked!", or an architect who said, "well, this is the designer, this is the design", and the dev goes and says, "well, but that didn't work, so we did it like this".

And what you are doing is, you are actually mapping reality. You are basically having a much better understanding of what reality actually means on the company. And what you are doing is you are mapping the truth. Threat model becomes a single source of truth of the company.

Moreover,it is also very important to capture those successes,to be able to advertise and promote and say that this is one of the reasons why you want to do a threat model because you want to understand what is going on, you want to make sure that everybody is in the same page in terms of development, QA, testing and everything.
